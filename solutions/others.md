# Other solutions

### B.Protocol <a id="bprotocol"></a>

BProtocol aims to shift MEV to users.

Users interact with existing lending platforms via B.Protocol smart contract. Liquidity providers \(LP\) provide a cushion to user debt, which gives B.Protocol precedence over other liquidators. LPs share their profits with the users, where user reward is proportional to his user rating.
