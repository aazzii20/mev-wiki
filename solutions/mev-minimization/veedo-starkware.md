VeeDo is StarkWareâ€™s STARK-based Verifiable Delay Function \(VDF\), and its PoC is now live on Mainnet. VeeDo's time-locks allow information to be sealed for a predetermined period of time \(during the sequencing phase\), and then made public.

2 approaches using privacy to minimize MEV

1. Time-locks as part of the protocol layer
2. Time-locks on Ethereum with smart contracts - supported today
