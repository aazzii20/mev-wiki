# ArcherSwap

Archerswap is a new DEX extension for Uniswap and Sushiswap that prevents frontrunning and offers traders zero slippage and zero cost cancellation swaps. This enables users to set slippage tolerance to 0%. Miners will only be paid if "acceptance criteria" are met, so any transaction that fails is not included on chain.

One is for searchers to submit Flashbots-compatible bundles. The other is the Archer Relay Network \(powers Archerswap\) where users can submit private transactions and be protected from malicious MEV.
