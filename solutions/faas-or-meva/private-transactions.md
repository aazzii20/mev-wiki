# Private Transactions

Typically, transactions are broadcast to the mempool where they remain pending until miners pick them and add to the block. Private transactions however, are only visible to the pool and are not broadcast to other nodes \(pay more for faster transactions\).

Examples include [1inch Exchange's Stealth Transactions](https://help.1inch.io/en/articles/4695716-what-are-stealth-transactions-and-how-they-work), [Taichi Network](https://taichi.network/) and [BloXroute](backrunme-by-bloxroute.md).
