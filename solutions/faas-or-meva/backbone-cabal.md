# BackBone Cabal

BackBone Cabal is a strategy that aims to extract MEV from SushiSwap. Profits are redistributed back to users who submitted trades in the first place in the form of eliminating their transaction cost \(up to 90%\).

YCabal creates a virtualized mempool \(i.e. a MEV-relay network\) that aggregates transactions \(batching\).

Users are able to opt in and send transactions to YCabal and in return for not having to pay for gas for their transaction, YCabal batch processes it and takes the arbitrage profit. Risk by inventory price risk is carried by a Vault, where Vault depositers are returned the profit the YCabal realizes.
