# Front-running as a Service \(FaaS\) or MEV Auctions \(MEVA\)

In a FaaS or MEVA system, MEV is extracted in a variety of ways such as miners auctioning off the right to front-run users.

> _'Centralizing MEV extraction is good because it quarantines a revenue stream that could otherwise drive centralization in other sectors.'_

> _Vitalik Buterin_

> _'In this article, I’m going to go deep into my personal arguments for why extracting MEV in cryptocurrencies isn’t like theft, why it is a critical metric for network security in any distributed system secured by economic incentives \(yes, including centralized ones\), and what we should do about MEV in the next 3-5 years as a community.'_
