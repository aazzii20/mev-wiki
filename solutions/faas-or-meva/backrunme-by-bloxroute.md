BackRunMe is a service that allows users to submit private transactions \(e.g. protection against frontrunning and sandwich attacks\) while allowing searchers to backrun the transaction via MEV IF it produces an arbitrage profit. If it doesn't generate an arbitrage profit it is processed as a regular private transaction. BackRunMe, gives a portion of this additional profit back to the user.

![How BackRunMe works.](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%288%29.png)

The profit sharing ratio is as follows:

![50% to miners, 25% to users, 20%to searchers and 5% to bloXroute.](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%289%29.png)

Users can use MetaMask directly on BackRunMe to trade on Uniswap or Sushiswap.
