# What is Miner Extractable Value?

When one sends a transaction on the blockchain, there is a delay between the time when the transaction is broadcast to the network and when it is actually mined into a block. During this period, transactions sit in a pending transaction pool called the mempool where contents are visible to everyone. Arbitrageurs and miners can monitor the mempool and find opportunities to maximize their own profits e.g. by frontrunning transactions. If a front-runner is a miner, they can also reorder or even censor transactions.

Miner Extractable Value refers to the amount of profit that can be extracted from reordering and censoring transactions on the blockchain.
