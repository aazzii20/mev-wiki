# Front-running

Front-running is the process by which an adversary observes transactions on the network layer and then acts upon this information by, for instance, issuing a competing transaction, with the hope that this transaction is mined before a victim transaction e.g. Transaction A is broadcasted with a higher gas price than an already pending transaction B so that A gets mined before B.
