# Automated Market Maker

A type of Decentralised Exchange. Contrary to traditional limit order-book-based exchanges \(which maintain a list of bids and asks for an asset pair\), AMM exchanges maintain a pool of capital \(a liquidity pool\) with at least two assets. A smart contract governs the rules by which traders can purchase and sell assets from the liquidity pool. The most common AMM mechanism is a constant product AMM, where the product of an asset \\(x\\) and asset \\(y\\) in a pool have to abide by a constant \\(k\\).

Examples of AMM Exchanges include [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/), [Sushiswap](https://sushi.com/), [Balancer](https://balancer.exchange/#/swap).
