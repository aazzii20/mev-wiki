# Lending Platforms

Debt is an essential tool in DeFi. As DeFi applications typically operate without Know Your Customer \(KYC\), the borrower’s debt must be over-collateralized. Hence, a borrower must collateralize \(lock\) 150% of the value that the borrower wishes to lend out. The collateral acts as a security to the lender if the borrower doesn’t pay back the debt.

Examples of lending platforms include [Aave](https://aave.com/) and [Compound](https://compound.finance/).
